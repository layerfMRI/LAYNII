## Opening an issue

- When reporting a bug, please specify your system and a complete copy of the error message that you are getting.

## Making a pull request

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine.
- Create a new branch to work on. Branch from `devel`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target `devel` branch of the original Segmentator repository.

__Note:__ Please write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code – not what you did to the code.
